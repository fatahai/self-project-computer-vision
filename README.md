# Self Project Computer Vision

Here is a collection of self-projects in Computer Vision using PyTorch to continue my learning from the Computer Vision Bootcamp at the Indonesia AI and to enhance problem-solving skills in various Computer Vision applications.

## 1. Gender Classification

This project utilizes the CelebA dataset consisting of 5000 photos containing a mix of males and females. The goal of this project is to experiment with building gender classification models using several pre-trained models. The models used include Inception V3, ResNet 50, and EfficientNet B2. This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation, Data Preprocessing, Model Building, Training, Evaluation, and Predictions.
